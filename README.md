# An-identifiable-denoisy-autoencoder-aligning-clinical-and-genomic-data
A PyTorch-based denoising autoencoder inspired by ICE-BeeM's identifiable architecture. Adapted MLP model for aligning clinical-genomic data, emphasizing identifiability to accurately invert genomic variations from clinical changes.
